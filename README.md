# What is Code katas?
Code Kata is an attempt to bring practice to software development. <br>
Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. <br>
The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.<br>

*I hear and I forget. <br>
I see and I remember. <br>
I do and I understand. <br>*
-- Confucius
